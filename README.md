# check-card-digit

Check Digits. Credit cards usually have a so-called check digit. This is a single digit that I assigned when the 
account number is developed and has a special property. One particularly simple mechanism is to assign the last digit 
of the sum of all the other digits. For example, suppose we have a nine-digit account number (including the check digit). 
The check digit would be the sum of the eight digits. This digit could be placed any whereâ€™s in the sequence, say the
third digit. As a full example, suppose the eight numbers are 12345678. Their sum is 36; thus, 6 is the check digit. 
The account number is therefore 126345678. Write a program to read in a nine digit integer from the keyboard and check it 
for these rules. Write"okay" or "not okay" for the results of the test.
